# Craver

This is an application for quick and easy access to a range of various server and experiment data. It currently has a focus around the LHCb, but could be expanded further. 


Currently the application supports a view of:

* LHCb control panel
* LbLogbook
* UP from Prometheus

Future plans are:
* Configurable alarms
* Log in with cern user
* Store personal user data on server/localy
