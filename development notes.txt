
Set up VM, remember to 
	export http_proxy=http://lbproxy01:8080
	export https_proxy=http://lbproxy01:8080
to get access to internet though pip, also make a file named .wgetrc with
	use_proxy=on
	http_proxy=http://lbproxy01:8080
	https_proxy=http://lbproxy01:8080
to automatically do it for wget (but pip uses something else)

The VM runs a virtual environment so in VS code, make sure that the selected python
interpereter is
	/home/vlundhei/craver/venv/bin/python3
or equivalent

In order to make flutter work i have dissabled web security.
Maybe this should be turned on some time.

I guess this might be because i'm not doing https but http.

When installing python libraries, you might run into ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mysql'.
Use: pip3 install mysql-connector, not just mysql.

Also, you should reference the pip in the venv, not just pip3, ie.:craver/venv/bin/pip3 install mysql-connector


When adding custom sounds to the project, you need to add them several places. Once for ios and once from android. Also ios does not support mp3.
See local notifications library for custom sound example

The server uses DIM. It was a bit problamatic to install.
remeber to unzip with -a. Very important.
